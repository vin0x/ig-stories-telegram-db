# Instagram Stories Downloader Bot

This project is a Telegram bot that downloads Instagram stories and stores them in a SQLite database. It allows users to download stories from Instagram profiles, view downloaded stories, and export the data as a CSV file.

_**PS:** This bot was used during the **Paris 2024 Olympic Games** to connect fans with athletes Instagram profiles and build a database of their memorable moments, this sample version of the project uses a smaller dataset to demonstrate key features with reduced complexity. Feel free to adapt this bot to suit your specific use case and research needs._

## Features

- Download Instagram stories from public profiles
- View downloaded stories
- Retrieve stories by Instagram user or Telegram user
- Saved histories are in a SQLite
